# Signed Network Representation with Novel Node Proximity Evaluation (Under Review)
Signed average first-passage time (SAFT) calucation and network representation implemented in Matlab.

## Overview
- `data/` contains splitted datasets;
- `SAFT.m` is the calculation of SAFT;
- `NetRpst.m` is the calculation of representations.

## Requirements
The implementation is tested under Matlab R2019b.

## Instruction
Copy this project to your Matlab. Run `SAFT.m` to calculate SAFT.

Next, use `NetRpst.m` to calculate representations with the temporal variables.
